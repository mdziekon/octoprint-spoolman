        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in octoprint-spoolman!**

          * First, be sure you are running the [latest version of the octoprint-spoolman plugin](https://github.com/mdziekon/octoprint-spoolman/releases).
          * You will also need to [enable debugging on the plugin](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/logging_yaml.html).
            * This may be done through the *Settings* > *OctoPrint* > *Logging* > *Logging Levels* section.
            * Select the "octoprint.plugins.Spoolman" name, and make sure Level is "DEBUG".
            * Save, then restart OctoPrint, which allows the developers to see debug information from the moment the plugin is loaded.
          * Finally, when submitting a bug report, you **must** [include a Systeminfo Bundle](https://community.octoprint.org/t/what-is-a-systeminfo-bundle-and-how-can-i-obtain-one/29887), generated after the point the bug occurs. This allows the developers to examine the debug logs produced from your plugin installation.

        Thank you for your help!

        Please also be sure to upload the following files below:

          * Systeminfo Bundle: See [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/what-is-a-systeminfo-bundle-and-how-can-i-obtain-one/29887) if you don't know where to find that. Just attach down below as-is. Note that you'll need at least OctoPrint 1.6.0 for this to be available - we no longer accept bug reports created for older versions than this.
            * If you are reporting an issue that involves communicating with you printer, **be sure to enable `serial.log` before reproducing and creating the Systeminfo Bundle**!
          * Your browser's JavaScript console, if you are reporting a problem with the
            user interface. See [here](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) on where to find that.
          * If possible, screenshots or videos showing the problem, especially if you
            are reporting a problem with the user interface!
          * GCODE files with which to reproduce, if you are reporting an issue with
            GCODE file analysis or printing behaviour.

        Please be aware that unless at least Systeminfo Bundle is included, your bug report
        will not be processed and closed after a while.
